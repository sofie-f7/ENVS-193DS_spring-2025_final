# ENVS-193DS_spring-2025_final

## General information

This repository is for all work done for my final for ENV S 193DS.

This is mine (sofie-f7), and I am the only contributer. 

The data was collected by me.

## Data and file information

There are two folders, a code folder and a data folder. All code is in the code folder, and the data is in the data folder. 

The data includes sea surface temperature in the Santa Barbara Channel data and nest occupancy data.

In the code folder, there is a file called "ENVS193DS_final.qmd" that contains all code for this analysis. The code folder also has some images that I have added to homework_03.qmd for easy access.
